Eridani Crops is a family owned hydroponic produce company in the DC area growing lettuce for local restaurants and individuals. The site has a fly-out sticky nav, fun animations & illustrations to show their mission as a company and drive people to their mailing list for fresh updates on all their crops.

The site uses a heavily customized version of the [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework with 3 responsive layouts. All this reminiscing is making me hungry.

Roles: *Front-end Development, Design, Illustration*
