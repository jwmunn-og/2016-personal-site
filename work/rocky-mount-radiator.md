    <p><strong>Rocky Mount Radiator and A/C</strong> is an expanding family business that was founded by Rocky Mount native Godfrey Giddeons in 1927. They are beginning to move their local business into two more niche markets and needed a logo system to tie all three brands together as they move forward.</p>

            <h2>Anatomy of the Mark</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The oval shape was derived from the previous version of logo to pay homage to their company history.</li>
                <li>The geometric structure is made up of intersecting circles to give the mark movement, symmetry and stability.</li>
                <li>The space between represents air flow by allowing the background to move through the mark.</li>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    
    <p>All logotypes are customized versions of Montserrat Bold. The typeface was chosen for itâ€™s circular geometry which served to match with both the circular make-up of the Rocky Mount Radiator mark as well as substitute as tires in the Carolina Clean Diesel logotype. The consistent typeface treatment throughout the 3 logotypes creates a cohesive company system tying the two sub-companies into the parent company.</p>
    
    <p>For related collateral, in print or web, Montserrat will be used for headlines and can be paired with Roboto for body text. This type pairing gives a clean and consistent look to all future brand materials.</p>
