    <h2>Typography</h2>
    
    <p>All logotypes are cusomized versions of Montserrat Bold. The typeface was chosen for itâ€™s circular geometry which served to match with both the circular make-up of the Rocky Mount Radiator mark as well as substitute as tires in the Carolina Clean Diesel logotype. The consistent typeface treatment throughout the 3 logotypes creates a cohesive company system tying the two sub-companies into the parent company.</p>
    
    <p>For related colatteral, in print or web, Montserrat will be used for headlines and can be paired with Roboto for body text. This type pairing gives a clean and consistent look to all future brand materials.</p>
