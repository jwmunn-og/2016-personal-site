            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>C1 wanted clean logo that set them apart visually from other Public Relation firms. As a boutique firm with a personal approach, C1 needed a distinct look to keep from blending in with their larger, more corporate competitors. To achieve this we decided on a simple mark, strong angled typography and a bold blue color palette with silver accents.</p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    
    <p>Since C1 is a small operation with a focus on personal attention. The main typeface needed to feel sturdy and dependable but have its own personality. The angled bowls and terminals of Strattum 1 by <a href="http://processtypefoundry.com/">Process Type Foundry</a> are apparent enough to play well with professional sports branding and athletes. However since C1 is not just a niche athlete firm, it remains professional enough to work in other industries and look at home on corporate letterhead.</p>
    
    <p>For presentations, slide decks, and printed material Strattum 1 is reserved for the logo and headlines then paired with Lato for all other copy. This system creates a clean, professional look with a modern, bespoke personality.</p>
