    <p><strong>Eridani Crops</strong> is a family run business with a simple vision: Bring the freshest, healthiest produce from the farm to the table with the smallest environmental impact. The site has a fly-out sticky nav, fun animations & illustrations to show their mission as a company and drive people to their mailing list for fresh updates on all their crops.</p>
    
    <p>The site uses a heavily customized version of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation 5</a> framework with 3 responsive layouts. All this reminiscing is making me hungry.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Since Eridani Crops was a new business at the time we wanted to take an illustrative landing page approach to build interest and a mailing list. They were still nailing down the process and deciding what produce they would be selling so illustration filled the gap until the business matured and the story could be told through photography.</p>
    
    <p>I created some custom lettering for their motto to <em>&ldquo;Feed 50 million people by 2050&rdquo;</em> or 50 by &rsquo;50 for short. The illustrations also show their local ties to the DC area through the cherry blossom tree.</p>

            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of the website was to build up an email list and tell the story behind the company. Since the company was hyperlocal, building a newsletter list was key to announce when their produce was ready for purchase and the locations where it will be sold.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m please to announce that this original landing page has served its purpose. As of today, the company has been successful in expanding and moved to a full website and produce sold at two Whole Foods locations. I&rsquo;m looking forward to see them grow.</p>
