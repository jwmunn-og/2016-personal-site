    <p>Web101 is a bi-weekly course over 6 months that teaches the principles of web design. Throughout the branding, organization, and launch I was been able to work with a fantastic team of people and help pull together a <a href="https://raleigh.aiga.org/events/web-101/">team of talented speakers</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Special thanks to Charles Mangin, Taylor Owens, Basia Coulter, Chris Davis and AIGA Raleigh Leadership and volunteers for all their work in helping make this class a reality.</p>

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>Web development can be intimidating for the uninitiated so we wanted the branding to feel friendly and approachable.</p>

    <h2>Website</h2>
    
    <p>The site served as a basic directory for links the students needed to access on a regular basis: Directions to the location, speaker/workshop schedule, and the discussion group.</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>This was my first time involved in planning an event of this size. Finding a location, sponsors, recruiting area speakers, recruiting volunteers, creating a pricing structure and event promotion were a fun challenge.</p>
            <p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without my Web101 team, advice from AIGA Raleigh leadership and the generous donation of time and knowledge by the Triangle web community.</p>
