## What is Epicurrence

Epicurrence is a *non-conference* started by Dann Petty that brings together designers and developers to have honest conversations and fun. The Montues was the 4th installment of the event series and an experiment to see if this simple idea would work at scale.

> Two full epic days of snowboarding, skiing, design, development, inspiration, collaboration, relationships, and adventure @ Northstar

## Pulling the Trigger

As excited to get an invite as I was, there was a bit of sticker shock when I saw the cost. Harder still was justifying it when you are living in Reno and already have a pass to Northstar. But then again, what are the chances that an event like this was dropping into my backyard? When are my design heroes, peers, location, and snowboarding going to find themselves in alignment again? Working remotely for the last two years made me long for a chance to make these connections so I moved forward with an easy conscience.

## Built for Conversations

Before the event even started, the conversations did. From the Slack channel to the initial carpool I instantly felt like I was connecting with people. That feeling only grew until it was over.

There are no slide decks, podiums or VIP rooms. The Montues is made for conversations. You share meals together, drink together, ride chairlifts together, rip through glades together, talk shop together, talk life together, and pack out hot tubs together. *You know everyone wants to hangout when there are 2 hot tubs full of people and an empty one next to the bar.*

People came from all different backgrounds and locations to share in this experience. I couldn&rsquo;t turn a corner without meeting another amazing human in this community. That togetherness left me humbled, greatful, and exhausted in the best way possible.

## Unexpected Vulnerability

The panels were honest in ways I&rsquo;ve never seen before. I had read about it from previous Epicurrences but once you&rsquo;re in the trust tree it&rsquo;s surprising to see how deep it runs. They shared stories of success, failure, and the weird grey area of being aquihired. The shared real numbers like salaries, expenses, and profits.
