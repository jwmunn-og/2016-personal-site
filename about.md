        <div class="half wrapper">
            <p>For the past 6 years, I&rsquo;ve been making a living as a designer and got the bug for coding websites back in 2011.</p>
            <h3>Brief History</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in South and North Carolina respectively. I&rsquo;m originally from Darlington, grew up in Rocky Mount, went to undergrad in Wilmington, and moved to Raleigh after graduation to begin my design career in 2010. While living in Raleigh I became a proud husband, and uncle. In June 2014, I started working remotely full-time and following my travel nurse wife <a href="http://susanandjustin.us">around the US</a>.</p>
            <h3>Current Status</h3>
            <p>I&rsquo;m living in <del>Lewes,&nbsp;DE</del> <del>Denver,&nbsp;CO</del> <del>Sacramento,&nbsp;CA</del> <del>Seattle,&nbsp;WA</del> <del>Reno, NV</del> <del>Grand Junction, CO</del> <strong>Seattle, WA</strong> until April. I spend as much time outside as possible hiking, camping and have a bit of a snowboarding problem. I&rsquo;m currently apprenticing as a web developer building web apps using <em>ruby</em> and <em>javascript</em> with <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The&nbsp;Firehose&nbsp;Project</a>, graduating June 2017.</p>
